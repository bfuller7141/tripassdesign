Diamond Fitness approached Tripass Design with a clear visionâ€”to reinvigorate their brand identity and create a visual language that resonated with motivation, determination, and movement. They sought a logo that conveyed power and energy without confusing their target audience, which primarily consisted of runners. The goal was to develop a cohesive visual identity that extended across various platforms, including social media, apparel graphics, and custom patterns.

We started by designing a logo that symbolized dynamic energy and determination, moving away from the previous weightlifting imagery to focus solely on running. The new logo evoked a sense of forward motion and progress, aligning perfectly with the app's core purpose.

The refreshed visual identity has revitalized the brand, positioning it as a motivating force in the running community. The cohesive branding across various platforms and merchandise has strengthened Diamond Fitness's connection with its audience, fostering a sense of unity and shared determination among runners using the app.
