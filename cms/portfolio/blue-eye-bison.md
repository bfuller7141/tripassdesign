  For the website, our goal was to create an online space where Blue Eye Bison’s
  stunning photography could truly shine. We focused on a clean, intuitive
  design that would highlight the images without unnecessary distractions. The
  website's layout was designed to guide visitors through a visual journey,
  showcasing the best of Blue Eye Bison's portfolio in a way that was both
  engaging and accessible.


  User experience was a top priority. We implemented a responsive design, ensuring the website looked impeccable on any device. The navigation was streamlined to allow visitors to easily explore galleries, learn about the photographer’s journey, and get in touch for inquiries. Integrating a blog section, we provided Blue Eye Bison with a platform to share stories behind the shots, tips on photography, and updates on their latest projects. This dynamic approach not only enhanced visitor engagement but also fostered a deeper connection between Blue Eye Bison and their audience.


  In both projects, our collaboration with Blue Eye Bison was driven by a shared passion for storytelling and a commitment to excellence. The result is a brand and website that not only represent Blue Eye Bison's artistry but also inspire and captivate their audience.

When Blue Eye Bison approached Tripass Design, they had a clear vision: to create a brand identity that echoed the depth and emotion of their photography. We started by diving into the essence of Blue Eye Bison, understanding the nuances of their work and the emotions they aimed to evoke. This journey began with an exploration of colors, fonts, and visual elements that would embody the spirit of their photography.

We crafted a logo that was both simple and profound, mirroring the duality of their work—finding beauty in simplicity. The logo's design elements were inspired by natural forms and earthy tones, reflecting the organic and grounded nature of Blue Eye Bison's photography. We wanted their brand identity to feel as authentic and captivating as their photos, creating a seamless connection between their visual art and their brand presence.
